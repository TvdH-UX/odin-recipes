            <li>400 gram waxy potatoes</li>
            <li>500 gram long beans</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of masala</li>
            <li>750 ml chicken stock</li>
            <li>4 roti sheets</li> 
            <li>1 madame jeanette pepper</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>pepper and salt</li>           
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onion and garlic cloves. Fry it briefly in a good layer of oil. Meanwhile, cut the chicken into medium sized pieces. When you have fried the onions and garlic for a minute, you can take them out and fry the chicken. Sear the chicken on the sides. The chicken does not have to be cooked yet.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut the potatoes into smaller pieces. When the chicken is well browned, add the onion, garlic and potatoes to the wok. Fry everything well and add the masala spices. Add the stock little by little, not all at once. The chicken and potatoes should not be completely submerged in the stock. Finally, add the Madame Jeanette pepper. Be careful, you have to add this whole and keep tasting your dish constantly. If the madame jeanette pepper breaks open, the roti will become very spicy very quickly.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, keep adding the stock until the potatoes are tender, which will take about 30 to 40 minutes. Finally, add the long beans to the dish. Cut it into pieces of 3 to 4 cm and add it 15 minutes before the end.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, hard-boil the eggs for about 8 to 10 minutes. Let them cool for a while in ice-cold water and peel off the skin and then fry them in a pan with a layer of oil until slightly crispy. You can warm the roti sheets in the pan or in the microwave. Serve a rotivel with the chicken mixture and egg on a plate. Then your Surinamese roti with chicken is ready, enjoy!</li>

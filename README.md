# odin-recipes

With this project, I will create a simple website containing a handful of recipes. 

The skills showcased with this project will be structuring a page with html, writing the boilerplate, adding headings, paragraphs, lists, links and images and looking up documentation or google/stackoverflow entries on any problems I encounter.
